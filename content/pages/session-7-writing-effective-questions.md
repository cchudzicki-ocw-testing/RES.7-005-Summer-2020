*Understanding the advantages, disadvantages, and pitfalls of different types of assessment questions.*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of different types of assessment questions.
2. Create assessment questions that are clear and concise, and engage different levels of student cognition.

## Facilitation Notes

Begin with a discussion of the purpose of assessment. You can do this exercise as a free form discussion or use an anonymous polling platform. Review the concept of formative vs. summative assessments.

Introduce the process of question design as one where the teacher needs to define what they want the student to do (i.e. what skill should they demonstrate). A helpful framework for this discussion is Bloom’s taxonomy, which helps to classify different levels of cognition. Emphasize that all levels of cognition are important ranging from foundational knowledge to high level processing. Verbs associated with Bloom’s taxonomy are extremely helpful in guiding question writing.

Ask folks to brainstorm questions they could ask surrounding a given topic. The topic provided here is viruses, but you can modify this to fit your needs. Invite TAs to pick a level of Bloom’s taxonomy and write down a rough idea for a question related to the topic. Provide a couple examples before sending them off to brainstorm. Invite as many folks to share back with the group as are willing.

Next, explore different question types using the slides provided. Emphasize the advantages and disadvantages of each type and highlight the tips for construction (excerpted from *Teaching at Its Best: A Research-Based Resource for College Instructors* by Linda B. Nilson). There are also examples given for each, which you may use or modify to fit your field. Consider emphasizing the importance of streamlining questions to reduce cognitive load on students, which is a common theme throughout all question types.
