*Teaching students how to think about their own learning using metacognition*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Define metacognition and its connection to successful student learning
2. Identify student learning strategies and classroom strategies that promote metacognition

## Facilitation Notes

Begin by asking TAs to debate whether learning and studying mean the same thing. This is typically best done as a free form discussion.

Explicitly define metacognition. What is it, why do we do it, and how can we achieve it? Provide some examples of metacognitive questions. To help folks understand the benefits of metacognition, consider walking students through the activity provided, which is from Saundra McGuire’s book (2015) entitled “Teach Students How to Learn: Strategies You Can Incorporate Into Any Course to Improve Student Metacognition, Study Skills, and Motivation.”

- TAs are instructed to count the vowels in the list of words/phrases provided and are given 45 seconds to do so.
- TAs are then asked to recall as many words as they can. A quick poll usually demonstrates that folks only remember a handful of terms (if any!). 
- Next, provide TAs with the list of words and ask them to identify an organizing principle, reading from top to bottom. Give folks a minute to think about it on their own, then discuss as a group. The terms are in number order.
- Give TAs another 45 sec to review the list and again ask them to recall as many words/phrases as they can. Most folks will remember many or all terms this time. 
- Follow up the activity by asking TAs what made the difference in their ability to remember the list between first and second trials.
