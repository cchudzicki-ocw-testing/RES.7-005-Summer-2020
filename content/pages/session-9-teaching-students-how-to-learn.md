*Teaching students how to think about their own learning using metacognition*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Define metacognition and its connection to successful student learning
2. Identify student learning strategies and classroom strategies that promote metacognition

## Facilitation Notes

Begin by asking TAs to debate whether learning and studying mean the same thing. This is typically best done as a free form discussion.

Explicitly define metacognition. What is it, why do we do it, and how can we achieve it? Provide some examples of metacognitive questions. To help folks understand the benefits of metacognition, consider walking students through the activity provided, which is from Saundra McGuire’s book (2015) entitled “Teach Students How to Learn: Strategies You Can Incorporate Into Any Course to Improve Student Metacognition, Study Skills, and Motivation.”
