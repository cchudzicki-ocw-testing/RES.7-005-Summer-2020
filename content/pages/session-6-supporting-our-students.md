*Showing empathy and promoting a growth mindset when students are struggling*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Identify ways of communicating with students that promote a growth mindset. 
2. Describe the elements of active listening and use active listening to support students.

## Facilitation Notes

Ask folks to reflect on a time when they felt most supported by a teacher. What did that look like? Have folks share out about their experiences or use an anonymous polling platform.

Not every challenge that a student is facing is apparent on the surface (from what we can observe). Discuss with TAs what other pressures or “unseen” challenges may exist.
