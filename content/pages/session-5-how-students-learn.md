## Facilitation Notes

Begin with a discussion that asks folks to reflect on what they think promotes student learning. They can think about this from the perspective of previous pedagogy discussions or from their own experiences in the classroom (either as student or teacher). You can do this exercise as a free form discussion or use an anonymous polling platform.

To frame the day’s reading, discuss where we get information about how students learn – research in cognitive science and classroom practices. This is covered in the introduction to the paper.
