## Biology Pedagogy Program Overview

This semester we will be supporting your teaching by providing a specialized Teaching Assistant (TA) training program in Biology Pedagogy, for which you can earn a training certificate. This program has been developed in response to the feedback of previous TAs, and is designed to actively meet your needs as you are teaching. It will provide practical knowledge that directly relates to your teaching responsibilities each week, and you will have the opportunity to practice different skills and techniques in a supportive environment.

There are six core sessions for the training program (1hr each):

- Organizing a recitation section to promote student learning
- Keeping students engaged
- Creating an inclusive classroom
- Providing constructive, equitable feedback
- How students learn
- Supporting our students

For the remaining sessions, you will have the option to choose your own adventure, and must choose at least one of the following special sessions to attend:

- Writing effective questions
- Making material relevant to motivate students
- Teaching students how to learn
- Helping students to learn the language of Biology
- Leveraging your teaching experience for the future 

Those who attend all 6 core training sessions, participate in a teaching observation session, and attend at least one "choose your own adventure" session, will receive a Biology Pedagogy Program Certificate from the department to acknowledge your accomplishment in completing the training program and pursuing professional development in teaching. For Biology graduate students, each pedagogy session you attend can also count toward your Professional Development requirement for the Biology graduate program.

## Goals & Intended Learning Outcomes

#### Goals for TAs

- **Communicate** clearly with a broad audience on a variety of topics in biology, and thoughtfully address questions which may arise in this setting.
- **Present** in a way that effectively aids communication, taking into account organization of materials, use of classroom space, and physical presence (i.e. body language, facial expression, tone, etc.).
- **Create a respectful learning environment** where students feel comfortable participating in the classroom, and teaching staff can work as a team to best serve students.
