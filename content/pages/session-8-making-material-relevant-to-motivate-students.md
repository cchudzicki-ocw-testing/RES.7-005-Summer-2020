*Helping students to see the value in what they’re learning*

## Intended Learning Outcomes

1. Understand sources of motivation for students and their impact
2. Apply strategies to increase student motivation

## Facilitation Notes

Begin by asking TAs to brainstorm what motivates students to learn something new. Folks can think about this in general or draw from personal experience. You can do this in a free form discussion setting, or use an anonymous polling platform.

While there are many factors that contribute to student motivation and many different theories and frameworks explaining motivation, this workshop focuses on the expectancy-value theory of motivation and three actionable areas for TAs to target in their teaching: Confidence, Context, and Choice. It can be helpful to share a personal example of how these factors have contributed to motivation in your own learning. Example:

Growing up, history courses in school were always difficult for me. I didn’t think I was any good at writing, and I didn’t see the relevance of remembering all those past events and dates. However, when given the option to write a history research paper on any topic of my choosing, I was able to find something that piqued my interest. I chose to write the paper on the Human genome project, a topic which I was passionate about given my interest in biology and genetics. The choice that my teacher gave me allowed me to 1) see the direct value in completing the task and 2) gave me more confidence to succeed because I was writing about something I was more familiar with.
